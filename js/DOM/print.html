<h2> Program to print the Current Content of the window using print() method </h2>  
<br> <br>  
<p>  
As the name suggests, the print () method is used to print the contents of the current window. When we use a print () method, it opens the print dialog box, which allows the user or programmer to select an appropriate option for printing the current content of the window. </p>  
<form>  
  
<!-- When a user click on the print button, the onclick function calls the window.print() method to print the currently visible content in the window screen. -->   
<input type = "button" value = "Print" onclick = "window.print()" />  
</form>
